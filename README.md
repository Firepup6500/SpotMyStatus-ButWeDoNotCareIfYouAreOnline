## Features
* User can pause/play status syncing
* User can choose to sync music and/or podcasts (default both)
* User can define emojis to rotate from when app sets a status. Emojis not present in the workspace will not be added 
(default ðŸŽ§, ðŸŽµ, ðŸŽ¶)
* User can define Spotify devices to sync from (default all)
* User can purge all their data from SpotMyStatus server

On each status update the status emoji is randomly picked from `:headphones:`, `:musical_note:` or `:notes:`.

On each poll the application does various checks:
* has user paused status updates
* is user offline
* has user manually changed their status(to avoid overwriting it)

If any of the above conditions are true, status is not updated.
